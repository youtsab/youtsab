The study set out to harness the capabilities of deep learning algorithms for detecting Pneumonia from pediatric chest X-ray images. DenseNet emerged as the superior model, achieving the highest test accuracy, likely due to its architectural efficiency and effective feature reuse. The standard CNN model also performed commendably, balancing depth and complexity adeptly to extract relevant features. The Hybrid CNN, while innovative, displayed lower accuracy, indicating that the amalgamation of multiple architectures may not necessarily confer an advantage in this context and could require additional optimization. VGG16, though a deep and established model, fell short in accuracy, potentially due to overfitting or a mismatch between the model's complexity and the dataset's characteristics.
